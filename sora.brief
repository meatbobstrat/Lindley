# 🧠 Structured Operational Awareness

This document exists to support continuity of AI collaboration across sessions. It is intended for AI agents working on the **Lindley** project — an archival assistant named for Lindley C. Branson. This file contains context, design state, development progress, and behavioral alignment expectations.

---

## 🏷️ Project Identity

* **Project Name**: Lindley
* **Named For**: [Lindley C. Branson](docs/lindley-c-branson.md) — educator, writer, historical figure
* **Purpose**: Assist in organizing, interpreting, and compiling large archives of scanned documents into structured, searchable PDFs with embedded metadata
* **Audience**: Historians, archivists, family researchers, power users — but designed to be usable by Grandma
* **Philosophy**: Lean into AI, minimize friction, build human trust through clarity, reversibility, and continuity

---

## 🧱 Architectural Goals

* **One-click installer**: Lindley should run without requiring technical setup

  * Bundles Redis, Tesseract, app core
  * No CLI dependencies, just launch and go
* **Local-first**: All processing occurs on the user’s machine
* **Watcher + Worker** separation:

  * `watcher`: Monitors for new scans, deduplicates, tracks in DB
  * `worker`: Performs OCR, metadata extraction, similarity matching, document grouping
* **SQLite + Redis** hybrid persistence
* **Inbox and Completed paradigms** for clear user flow

---

## 🧠 AI Alignment + Role

* The AI (you) is expected to:

  * Assist in architectural decisions
  * Provide feature ideation when asked
  * Maintain memory of app state, naming conventions, and workflows
  * Contribute UX/packaging advice when relevant
  * Write code or shell commands only after asking clarifying questions when needed — **never** after code has already been generated
  * Focus on the task at hand — no rabbit holes or speculative coding
  * Work one file at a time; all production code must clearly indicate the filename being updated
  * Clearly label example vs. production code blocks
  * Provide terminal commands in **copy/pasteable** form — no prompt decoration like `PS C:\>` or `$`
  * Use a tone that is helpful, precise, and fast — **not twee or verbose**

## 📦 Current Project Status (As of Oct 1, 2025)

### ✅ Watcher: MVP Complete

* Watches folders
* Deduplicates scans
* Populates DB
* Uses settings.json for config

### 🟡 Worker: Near-MVP

* OCR logic in progress
* Grouping/association logic next
* Output to be stored in SQLite and surfaced to UI

### ✅ Bin Directory

* Created to hold `redis-server`, `tesseract`, and other binaries
* Supports the one-file installer model

---

## 🧪 First-Run Experience (Future State)

1. Installer runs
2. Embedded Redis and Tesseract launch silently
3. Lindley starts watching default folder
4. Sample data (Lindley C. Branson's writings) are included to demonstrate functionality

---

## 🔁 Session Behavior

* This document is:

  * **Read** at the beginning of each new dev session
  * **Updated** at the end to reflect latest changes, decisions, or TODOs
* Acts as both continuity mechanism and mission briefing for the AI
* Not intended for public consumption — humans get the README.md

---

## 🧭 Next Immediate Tasks

* [ ] Finish OCR + metadata processing logic in `worker/`
* [ ] Begin prototype of folder suggestion engine (via text similarity)
* [ ] Decide on method for packaging and launching Redis + Tesseract (subprocess? supervisor?)
* [ ] Draft `docs/lindley-c-branson.md`
